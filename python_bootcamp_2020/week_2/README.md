## Assignments

In progress

- You can use main function to predefine anything but make sure you divide everything you can in functions.
- Submit your github folder link and your output on Google Classroom
- Make sure you fork [https://github.com/sinnytk/Python-Bootcamp-DSC-DSU](https://github.com/sinnytk/Python-Bootcamp-DSC-DSU), clone the repo locally and create your scripts in the respective week's folder and push it.
- Make sure in each folder there's a [readme.md](http://readme.md) file with code output and brief explanation of what you did and why you did it (not necessary, but good practice)
