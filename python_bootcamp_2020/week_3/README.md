## Assignment

### 1. Take as user input a Facebook post link and have your bot like the post and share it on your timeline

Notes:

- You'll need to use m.facebook.com for ease
- For submission, like and share this post: https://www.facebook.com/groups/380137593049071/permalink/389411455455018/
- The shared post should have the following caption(also sent through Selenium bot):
  - "This post was shared using a bot that I learnt to create from Python Bootcamp 2020 held by DSC@DSU. #DSCDSU #DeveloperStudentClubs #DSCPakistan #Python #Bot"
- The caption is not strict, but should contain the hashtags even if you modify your message according to your flavor.
- You'll need to submit a video recording of you running the script and showing the bot performing the liking and sharing of above mentioned post.

**Optional, extra marks** : Make the bot comment on the above mentioned post as well.

### 2 **Optional, extra marks**: make the bot created above make at least 50 comments in succession on the page. These 50 comments should be lines split from a paragraph you may write on:

- Your aims and goals after this bootcamp?
- How did you like the instructors and the management?
- What did you learn from the bootcamp?
- Would you be willing to carry the legacy forward for a free, open source driven tech bootcamp like this one?

- You can use main function to predefine anything but make sure you divide everything you can in functions.
- Submit your github folder link, your output(in form of video this time) on Google Classroom
- Make sure you fork [https://github.com/sinnytk/Python-Bootcamp-DSC-DSU](https://github.com/sinnytk/Python-Bootcamp-DSC-DSU), clone the repo locally and create your scripts in the respective week's folder and push it.
- Make sure in each folder there's a [readme.md](http://readme.md) file with code output and brief explanation of what you did and why you did it (not necessary, but good practice)
